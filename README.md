# Memory Game

Welcome to the Memory Game, a C# application that demonstrates a solid implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. 
This project is structured to separate concerns into distinct classes, encapsulating UI components, game logic, and more.

## Description

The Memory Game is a classic card matching game where the player flips over pairs of cards to find matching pairs. The game ends when all pairs have been successfully matched.
This project serves as a demonstration of best practices in C# programming, focusing on clear class structures and OOP principles.

## Features

- Responsive and interactive UI for engaging gameplay.
- Well-defined game mechanics and rules.
- Clear division of responsibilities across different classes.
